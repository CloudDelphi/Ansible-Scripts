# Each valid address user@example.org is aliased (on the MX) into some
# example.org/user@xxx.fripost.org, and non-defaults next-hop:port are
# chosen here in that table, depending on 'xxx'.  The reason for such
# indirection is that there is only one qmgr(8) daemon, which delegate
# the routing strategy to the trivial-rewrite(8), which in turns queries
# transport_maps.  Hence high latency maps such as LDAP or SQL would
# congestion the queue manager.  On the other hand, virtual aliasing is
# performed by cleanup(8), multiples instances of which can run in
# parallel. See http://www.postfix.org/ADDRESS_REWRITING_README.html .
#
# /!\ WARNING: xxx.fripost.org should NOT be in the list of valid
# domains ($virtual_alias_domains)!  Otherwise at the next iteration of
# the alias resolution loop the domain will be validated but not the
# address, and the MTA will reply with "Recipient address rejected: User
# unknown in virtual alias table".
